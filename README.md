# 🦴 Bone Issue Prediction – Osteoporosis / Osteoarthritis Classifier

Early detection of bone‐related conditions such as **Osteoporosis** and **Osteoarthritis** is crucial for preventing fractures and improving quality of life.  
This project walks through a full **data‑science pipeline**—from raw patient data to a deploy‑ready machine‑learning model—that predicts whether an individual has a bone disease based on physiological and lifestyle metrics.

## Project Motivation
* **Clinical Relevance:** Osteoporosis often remains undiagnosed until a fracture occurs. A data‑driven screening tool can prompt earlier diagnostics.  
* **Data Challenge:** The dataset mixes numerical labs (e.g., BMD, Vitamin D) and categorical lifestyle factors (Smoking, Exercise). This calls for thoughtful preprocessing and robust model selection.  
* **Learning Goals:** Showcase end‑to‑end ML workflow—EDA, feature engineering, baseline vs. tuned models, and clear evaluation—suitable for a data‑science resume.

Feature Highlights:
T‑score and BMD show the strongest negative correlation with disease severity.
Lifestyle factors (exercise frequency, smoking) shift risk distributions.
Interactive visuals (Seaborn/Matplotlib) illustrate distributions, outliers, and heat‑map correlations—see 01_eda.ipynb for details.
